# iOS Test Solutions
To test this app, download this entire project folder, which contains inside the `.xodeproj` file to run. 

Please note that I have used Swift 4.2, a migration to Swift 5.0 was available but I chose to not do it because it is not as widely used yet. 
Finally, make sure when testing that the volume is turned up, I have added some cool audio effects!

As for the total time estimate and breakdown, it would be as follows:
Time spent = ~16 hours

-   Reading and understanding instructions: 5%
-   Familiarizing myself with the code already written: 5%
-   Creating/coding initial UI to resemble mock-up: 15%
-   Research (mainly Apple Developer Documentation and Stack Overflow): 15%
-   Planning of custom classes and functions: 10%
-   Purely programming time: 30%
-   Testing of functions and UI: 20%

Note that this is not the exact time division, but rather an approximation. Thank you once again for this opportunity, I hope you enjoy my app!
